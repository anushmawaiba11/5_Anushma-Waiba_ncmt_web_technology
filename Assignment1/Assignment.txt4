Group A: Short Questions (2 Marks )
1. Differentiate between Legibility and Readability

Legibility refers to how easily individual characters (letters, numbers, symbols) can be distinguished from one another. It depends on factors like font style, font size, spacing, and contrast.
For example, a clean sans-serif font like Arial is more legible than a decorative script font.

Readability, on the other hand, refers to how easily blocks of text can be read and understood. 
It focuses on sentence length, paragraph structure, line spacing, and overall layout. Even if text is legible, poor readability (long paragraphs, small line height) can make content tiring to read.

2. What is the “Rule of Thirds” in layout design?

The Rule of Thirds is a design principle where a page is divided into nine equal parts using two horizontal and two vertical lines. 
Important content is placed along these lines or at their intersections.
This creates a balanced and visually appealing layout, guiding the user’s eye naturally and preventing important elements from being centered rigidly or placed randomly.

3. Why should you limit the number of font families used on a website?

Limiting font families ensures visual consistency, professionalism, and faster loading times.
Using too many fonts can confuse users, make the site look cluttered, and distract from the content.
Typically, using two to three font families (one for headings, one for body text) maintains clarity and improves user experience.

4. Define “Responsive Web Design.”

Responsive Web Design (RWD) is an approach where a website automatically adjusts its layout, images, and 
content to fit different screen sizes and devices such as desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
It uses flexible layouts, fluid images, and CSS media queries to ensure usability and readability across all devices.

5. Explain the “F-Pattern” of scanning and how it influences the placement of content on a web page

The F-Pattern is a common eye-movement pattern observed in users when they scan web pages, especially those containing text such as articles, blogs, or news websites. 
Eye-tracking studies reveal that users rarely read word-by-word; instead, they scan the page in an “F” shaped pattern.
First, users read horizontally across the top portion of the page, focusing on headings and the first few lines. 
Next, they move slightly downward and scan another horizontal section. Finally, they scan vertically down the left side of the page, looking for keywords or points of interest.
This behavior influences web design by encouraging designers to place important content, headlines, navigation menus, logos, and 
call-to-action buttons along the top and left areas of the page. Content placed in these zones gains more attention, improving usability and user engagement.

6. Discuss the psychological impact of colors in web design with examples

Color plays a powerful role in web design as it directly affects human emotions, perceptions, and decision-making. 
Different colors communicate different messages and influence how users feel about a website or brand.
Blue creates a sense of trust, calmness, and professionalism. It is commonly used in corporate websites, financial institutions, and social networks because it builds confidence and reliability.
Red represents energy, urgency, passion, and excitement. It is often used in sale banners, alert messages, and call-to-action buttons to encourage quick user responses.
Green symbolizes nature, health, growth, and balance. 
It is widely used in environmental websites, healthcare platforms, and finance apps to represent stability and positivity.
By selecting colors carefully, designers can enhance user experience, strengthen brand identity, and influence user behavior effectively.

7. Explain the “60-30-10 Rule” regarding color balance on a website

The 60-30-10 Rule is a color design principle used to create visually appealing and balanced layouts. 
It divides color usage into three proportions to maintain harmony and avoid visual clutter.
60% Dominant Color: This is the primary color used for backgrounds and large areas. It sets the overall tone of the website.
30% Secondary Color: This color supports the dominant one and is used for headers, menus, and content sections.
10% Accent Color: This is a contrasting color used for highlights, buttons, icons, and call-to-action elements.
Using this rule ensures that the website looks organized, aesthetically pleasing, and 
that important elements stand out without overwhelming the user.

8. Importance of Image Optimization and File Formats (JPEG vs PNG) in Website Performance (10 Marks)

Website loading speed is a critical factor that directly affects user experience, bounce rate, and search engine ranking. 
When high-resolution raw images from a camera are used directly on a website, they significantly increase page size, causing slow loading times and user abandonment.
Image Optimization
Image optimization is the process of reducing image file size without noticeably affecting visual quality. 
Optimized images load faster, consume less bandwidth, and improve overall website performance. Benefits include:
Faster page load times
Improved user retention
Better mobile performance
Higher SEO rankings
Optimization techniques include resizing images to required dimensions, compressing files, and choosing the correct image format.

Importance of Choosing Correct File Formats
JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)
Uses lossy compression, which reduces file size by removing unnecessary data
Best suited for photographs and complex images
Produces smaller file sizes compared to PNG
Faster loading time, ideal for galleries and background images
PNG (Portable Network Graphics)
Uses lossless compression, preserving full image quality
Supports transparency
Best for logos, icons, illustrations, and text-based images
Larger file size compared to JPEG
Solution to the Problem
Instead of using raw camera images, the developer should resize images to screen-appropriate dimensions, compress them, and 
convert them to JPEG for photos and PNG only when transparency is required. This reduces load time, improves performance, and enhances user experience.

9. Critique of Bright Yellow Background and Comic Sans for a Law Firm Website (10 Marks)
A law firm website must communicate professionalism, trust, authority, and credibility. 
The proposed design choice of a bright yellow background with Comic Sans font conflicts with fundamental principles of Color Theory and Typography.
Color Theory Critique
Bright yellow is an intense and highly stimulating color. While it may appear cheerful, it:
Causes eye strain when used as a background
Reduces readability of text
Conveys playfulness rather than seriousness
Lacks the authority expected from legal services
Yellow is more suitable as an accent color, not a dominant background for professional websites.
Typography Critique
Comic Sans is an informal, decorative font associated with children’s content and casual communication. Its use in a law firm website:
Reduces credibility and seriousness
Appears unprofessional
Undermines client trust
Typography should match the tone of the business; law firms require formal and readable fonts.
Better Alternative
Color Scheme: Use neutral or cool colors such as navy blue, dark gray, white, or beige to reflect trust and professionalism.
Typography: Use serif fonts like Times New Roman or Georgia for authority, or clean sans-serif fonts like Roboto or Helvetica for modern professionalism.
This alternative aligns with color psychology and typography principles, creating a trustworthy and professional brand image.

10. Missing Design Principle and Role of Media Queries and Fluid Grids (10 Marks)

The missing design principle in this scenario is Responsive Web Design.
A responsive website adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices, ensuring usability across desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
Problem Explanation
When a website looks good on a laptop but requires zooming and horizontal scrolling on mobile devices, it indicates:
Fixed-width layouts
Non-flexible images
Lack of mobile optimization
This results in poor user experience and increased bounce rates.
Media Queries
Media Queries are a feature of CSS that allow designers to apply different styles based on screen size, resolution, or device orientation.
They help:
Adjust font sizes for smaller screens
Reposition navigation menus
Stack content vertically on mobile devices
Fluid Grids
Fluid grids use relative units like percentages instead of fixed pixels. This allows:
Layouts to resize proportionally
Content to fit any screen width
Elimination of horizontal scrolling

Solution
By combining media queries with fluid grids, designers can create flexible layouts that adapt automatically to all devices.
This ensures readability, accessibility, and consistent user experience across platforms.
